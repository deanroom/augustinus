# Rule: General Philosophical Writing Standards

The following principles apply to all philosophical writing in this project:

## 1. Academic Rigor
*   **Evidence-Based Claims:** Every substantive claim must be supported by textual evidence or argument.
*   **Charitable Reading:** Present others' views in their strongest form before critiquing them.
*   **Intellectual Honesty:** Acknowledge limitations in your argument and address potential objections.
*   **Precision:** Use language with technical precision; define terms when introducing them.

## 2. Logical Structure
*   **Clear Argumentation:** Arguments should have identifiable premises and conclusions.
*   **Progressive Development:** Each paragraph and section should build logically upon previous ones.
*   **Coherent Organization:** The overall structure should be coherent and purposeful, not merely a collection of related points.

## 3. Scholarly Standards
*   **Proper Citation:** All references to other works must be properly cited.
*   **Engagement with Literature:** Demonstrate familiarity with relevant scholarly literature.
*   **Original Contribution:** Make clear how your work contributes to the existing philosophical conversation.

## 4. Stylistic Elements
*   **Economy of Expression:** Be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition or verbosity.
*   **Clarity over Complexity:** Express complex ideas as clearly as possible without oversimplification.
*   **Academic Register:** Maintain a formal, scholarly tone throughout all writing.

## 5. Philosophical Methodology
*   **Critical Analysis:** Question assumptions, examine implications, and evaluate arguments.
*   **Conceptual Clarity:** Distinguish related concepts and avoid equivocation.
*   **Principle of Charity:** Interpret texts and arguments in their strongest, most coherent form.
