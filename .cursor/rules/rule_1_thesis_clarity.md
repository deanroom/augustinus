# Rule: Thesis Clarity and Precision

## 1. State a Thesis, Not Just a Topic
The core aim is to defend a **thesis**, which must be a specific claim formulatable in a declarative sentence (e.g., "Hume's skepticism about induction is unwarranted"). It cannot be just a broad topic area (e.g., "Hume on induction").

## 2. Be Focused and Precise
*   **Focus:** The thesis must be narrow enough to be adequately defended within the available space (e.g., a specific chapter section, not the entire proposal). Avoid overly broad claims (e.g., "Time is an illusion").
*   **Precision:** The thesis must be stated precisely enough so that it's clear what counts as evidence *for* it and what would count as a *refutation* of it. Avoid vague terms or clearly define them if necessary (e.g., specify what "common sense" entails if arguing Hume conflicts with it).

## 3. Position Thesis Clearly in Introduction
The thesis statement should be explicitly stated, usually towards the end of the introduction. Use clear signposting language like:
*   "In this section/paper, I will argue that..."
*   "My central claim is that..."
*   "What I will try to show is that..."

## 4. Defend the Thesis
Remember that the purpose is not just to state the thesis (or opinion) but to **defend it** by providing reasons and arguments throughout the text.
