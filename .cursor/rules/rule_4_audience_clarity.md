# Rule: Audience Awareness and Clarity

Assume the reader is intelligent but **not** an expert in your specific philosophical topic, nor necessarily well-versed in philosophy generally. They are interested but impatient and easily bored, requiring clear motivation and guidance.

## 1. Ensure Ready Intelligibility
*   **Know Your Point:** For every sentence, know exactly what claim, clarification, or transition it makes.
*   **Clarity of Expression:** Use clear, direct language. Avoid unnecessary jargon. Define technical terms explicitly when first used.
*   **Motivation:** Ensure the reader always understands *why* a particular point is being made *at that specific place* in the text. Avoid abrupt shifts. Use transition phrases.
*   **Background:** Provide necessary context for claims, arguments, or positions discussed. Do not assume shared knowledge from specific texts or courses.
*   **Elaboration:** Use examples and illustrations to clarify abstract points.

## 2. Do Not Write For Yourself or Your Instructor
*   Avoid explaining concepts solely based on the way *you* came to understand them. Present the idea logically and provide the necessary background for a general reader.
*   Do not assume the reader (even your instructor) shares your immediate background, readings, or specific course context. Write to communicate your understanding and argument effectively to an external intelligent reader.

## 3. Explicit Connections
Explicitly state connections between ideas, premises, and conclusions. Do not rely on the reader to make subtle inferences or connections themselves. Guide the reader through your line of reasoning step-by-step.

## 4. Professional Tone
*   Maintain a formal, objective, and analytical tone suitable for a serious academic audience in philosophy/theology/classics. 
*   Avoid colloquialisms, overly simplistic language, and generic explanatory styles.
*   Use precise terminology appropriate to the field while still ensuring clarity for the non-specialist reader.
