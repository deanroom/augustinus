# Rule: Strictness on Sources and Text Analysis

When investigating, reading, and analyzing philosophical texts, apply these principles:

## 1. Ensure Every Word is Sound
*   **Strictly use the provided resources:** Base all analysis only on the primary and secondary literature explicitly provided by the user. Do not reference external databases or sources not included in the provided materials.
*   **Make summary with evidence:** All summaries and conclusions must be supported by related passages in the text, with relevant quotations included in the answer. For philosophical positions (e.g., Augustine's views), prioritize direct quotations from primary sources rather than secondary commentary.
*   **Quotation in standard form:** List sources in the format (author name, book name, pages or chapter number) immediately following each quotation.
*   **Intellectual honesty:** Do not provide conclusions or views without textual evidence. When information cannot be found in the provided sources, explicitly acknowledge this limitation rather than making unsupported claims.
