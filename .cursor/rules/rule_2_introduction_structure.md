# Rule: Structuring Philosophical Introductions

Every introduction must accomplish three key tasks concisely:

## 1. Motivate the Project
*   Explain *why* the thesis or topic matters. Make the reader care about whether the thesis is true.
*   Connect the specific thesis to broader philosophical concerns or debates if necessary.
*   Address the question: "Why is this discussion important or interesting?"

## 2. Provide Essential Background
*   Define any technical terms used in the thesis statement that the target audience (intelligent non-expert) might not know.
*   Briefly outline the context or debate into which the thesis fits.
*   Ensure the reader understands *what the thesis means* before you start arguing for it.

## 3. State the Thesis Clearly
*   Explicitly state the focused, precise thesis you will defend (as per the 'Thesis Clarity and Precision' rule).
*   Use clear signposting language (e.g., "I will argue that...", "My aim here is to show that...").
*   Optionally, briefly outline the structure of the argument or paper/section that follows.

**Note:** Introductions should be relatively short and written clearly. It's often best to draft the introduction *after* drafting the main body of the argument.
